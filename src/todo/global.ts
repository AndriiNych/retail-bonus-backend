//TODO consider interception and middleware

//TODO Try to make sure that types and schemas from parent classes are passed to swagger

//TODO in all services implement feature check isExist and create error message "not found" in delete & update functions

//TODO in receiptService make check that startData >= currentDate, and only then do delete/update

//TODO Change internal private methods "get" to "fetch"

//TODO update all responseWrapper with "data" to wrapperResponseEntity

//TODO Perhaps it makes sense to move the posting procedure to the business logic or service (the part where postings are made)?

//FIXME Try using PickType from the swager module. Maybe this will help when creating swager documentation

//[x] use all functions for posting receipts to registers from the general functions written for daily tasks
